# Self-Feedback Pipeline for Text Simplification Using Large Language Models (LLMs)

This project focuses on creating an automated self-feedback pipeline that simplifies complex text while preserving its original meaning. By using multiple large language models (LLMs) and iterative feedback, the pipeline refines text through successive improvements.

## Project Contents

- **`code.py`**: Contains the Python code for the self-feedback pipeline.
- **`Results plot.jpg`**: A plot generated by the pipeline displaying BERTScore improvements across iterations for each model.
- **`Experiments.csv`**: Stores details from each run, including model name, iteration number, original text, simplified text, and BERTScore.
- **`Project Report.pdf`**: A two-page summary report on the project methodology and outcomes.
- **`Data.txt`**: A text file containing the input text data used to implement the pipeline.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure the following Python packages are installed:

- `openai`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `bert_score`

## How to Run

- Open the `code.py` file.
- Install the required libraries (if not already installed).
- Replace `api_key` with your own OpenAI API key.
- Configure Models: The models parameter includes OpenAI models (e.g., gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo) that the pipeline will use. Make sure the specified models are accessible in your API plan.
- Run the File: Execute code.py in your Python environment.
- Provide Input: When prompted, enter the text youâ€™d like to simplify. The pipeline will begin processing and iteratively simplify the input text.
