# Self-feedback pipeline for text simplification using Large language models (LLM).

The project focuses on building an Automated self-feedback pipeline to simplify the complex text while retaining the actual meaning. 

## Project content

- `code.py`: It consist the python code for the self-feedback pipeline.
- `Results plot`: This is the plot generated by the code for each run
- `Experiments`: This file contains Model name,Iteration, Original text, Simplified_Text and BERT Scores for each run.
- `Project report` : Short 2 pages paper on the project
- `Data`: This file contains the text used for implementing the pipeline.

## Requirements

To run this code, you need the following Python packages:

- `openai`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `bert_score`

## How to run

- Open the `code.py` file
- Install the required libraries
- Replace the `api_key` with your Openai api key
- The models parameter includes OpenAI models (gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo, etc.) that the pipeline will use. Ensure that the models you specify are available in your API plan.
- Run the file
- Provide the text input through the terminal to get the output.
